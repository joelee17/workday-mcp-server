‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

1. Requires proper Workday SOAP API permissions
2. Integration user must have payroll input/payment submission rights
3. Earning codes and currency references must exist in the system
4. Payment dates should follow company payroll calendar
5. Business process auto-completion bypasses approval workflows

üéØ Use Cases:

- Performance bonuses
- Overtime payments
- Expense reimbursements
- Retroactive pay adjustments
- Special recognition payments
